# HunterProject
VR Pet Simulator

The goal of the Hunter Project is to develop a VR pet simulator, in honor of my cat, Hunter, who passed away suddenly from liver cancer on August 13th, 2019. This is a labour of love for me and I do not intend to make any kind of profit off this.

The intent is to develop a general framework for interacting with a virtual pet in a VR environment. While my own personal goal is to create a likeness of Hunter with his own behaviours, the game will be designed to allow others to easily create and customize their own pet. It is an open source project and will be freely available for anyone to download and modify.
